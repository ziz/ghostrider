**ghostrider** is a script meant to help farming Dread, specifically for the Mayor Ghost photo booth supply list runs.

To install, run the following command on an up-to-date KolMafia version:

```
git checkout ziz/ghostrider release
```

## Running ghostrider

In its simplest form, running ghostrider involves:

```
ghostrider
```

or

```
ghostrider [turns]
```

where `[turns]` is either the number of turns you want to run (positive) or the minimum number of turns you'd like to be left with when it's done (negative).

```
ghostrider help
```

Will list additional options that you may run.

This script is a mess. Blame sepos. It's also heavily based on <https://github.com/loathers/freecandydotexe/>.
